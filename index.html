        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a Greek citizen and my mother sponsored me in 2008 to come to the States on a permanent basis to live and work. It has taken all this time for an available visa and processing but now I have recently arrived with an approved green card and a social security number. I am an experienced sales representative with 14 years of work experience and 7+ years in the pharmaceutical industry. My career in Athens has been distinguished by quota-surpassing sales and numerous honors but increasingly I have been disappointed like many others with the Greek economy which has made it difficult to plan a career. </p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>I have been to the U.S. several times and want to embrace this unexpected opportunity after so many years of waiting. I really believe that teaching myself how to become a programmer will be one of the best decisions that I have made for my career. I always had a keen interest in technology but I never pursued my dream of making my hobby my profession. This is my first step towards becoming a Front End developer. While I am very aware that I have a lot of ground to cover, my motivation is strong and I am sure I will reach my goal in the end.</p>
